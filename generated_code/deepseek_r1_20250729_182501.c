We are going to create a simple Linux character device driver with a 1KB buffer.
 The driver will support basic read and write operations.

 Steps:
 1. Define the necessary macros and global variables.
    - We'll have a buffer of 1024 bytes (1KB).
    - We need a major number; we can let the kernel assign it dynamically.
    - We'll have a structure to represent our device which will hold the buffer and other necessary data.

 2. Implement the file operations structure (struct file_operations) with:
    - .owner = THIS_MODULE
    - .read = device_read
    - .write = device_write
    - .open = device_open
    - .release = device_release

 3. Implement the functions for open, read, write, and release.

 4. Register the device during module initialization and unregister during exit.

 Important: We need to handle concurrency. We'll use a mutex to protect the buffer.

 Let's design the device:
   - We'll have a static buffer of 1024 bytes.
   - We'll keep track of the current size (how many bytes are written).
   - We'll use a mutex to protect the buffer and the size.

 For read:
   - Copy data from the buffer to the user, starting from the beginning (like a simple FIFO?).
   - But note: the problem says "basic read/write", so we can do a simple sequential device.

 However, note: the typical behavior of a character device is that writes append to the buffer and reads start from the beginning and then we reset? 
 But we have a fixed buffer. We have to decide:

 Option 1: Circular buffer? (but the problem says basic, so maybe not required)
 Option 2: On read, we return the entire buffer (up to the current size) and then reset the buffer? But that would be destructive read.

 Let's do: 
   - We'll have a buffer and a size. When we write, we overwrite the entire buffer? Or we append? 
   - Since it's a 1KB buffer, we can only hold 1KB. We'll do:

   On write:
     - If the user writes more than 1KB, we truncate to 1KB and discard the rest.
     - We will overwrite the previous content.

   On read:
     - We read from the beginning up to the current size (which is the last written data, and the size is the length of that data, max 1024).
     - After reading, we do not reset the buffer? But then if we read again, we get the same data? 
     - We can reset the size to 0 after a read? That would be a destructive read.

   Alternatively, we can have a read pointer? But again, the problem says basic.

   Let me re-read: "basic read/write operations". We can do:

     - Writing to the device will replace the entire buffer with the new data (up to 1KB). If the write is less than 1KB, we only store that much and set the size accordingly.
     - Reading from the device will return the current buffer (from the beginning) and then reset the buffer (set size to 0) so that the next read returns 0 until a new write.

   But note: what if multiple processes are using the device? We don't want one process to read the data written by another process after the first one has read it? 
   We'll use a mutex to protect the entire buffer and the size.

   However, the above behavior (resetting on read) might be unexpected. Alternatively, we can leave the buffer until it is overwritten? Then multiple reads will get the same data.

   Let's decide: we'll leave the buffer until a new write. So multiple reads will get the same data until a new write happens.

   But note: if we do that, then we need to track the read position? Actually, no: each read should start from the beginning? 

   We can do:

     - We have a buffer and a size (the amount of data currently stored).
     - Read: copies the entire buffer (up to the current size) to the user, and returns the number of bytes read. It does not change the buffer or the size.
     - Write: overwrites the buffer with the new data (up to 1024 bytes) and sets the size to the number of bytes written.

   But then, what if the user writes 10 bytes, then 20 bytes? The second write will overwrite the first 20 bytes and set the size to 20? Then the buffer has 20 bytes of the second write and the next 10 bytes of the first write? That would be bad.

   So we must clear the buffer on write? Actually, we should only write up to the number of bytes and set the size accordingly. The rest of the buffer (if any) is not cleared, but we don't care because we only read up to the current size.

   However, if we write less than the previous write, then the buffer will have the new data and then the old data beyond the new size. But we won't read beyond the current size.

   Example:
     - Write "HelloWorld" (10 bytes) -> buffer has "HelloWorld", size=10.
     - Then write "Bye" (3 bytes) -> buffer becomes "Bye" followed by "loWorld"? 
        Actually, we are going to copy only 3 bytes: so the buffer becomes "Bye" and then the rest is still there? 
        But we set the size to 3, so when we read we only get "Bye".

   So that's acceptable.

   Alternatively, we can zero out the buffer on each write? But that would be inefficient. We don't need to because we are tracking the size.

 5. We'll use:
      static char device_buffer[1024];
      static size_t device_buffer_size = 0;   // current number of bytes stored
      static DEFINE_MUTEX(device_mutex);

 6. For read:
      - Check if the current position (in the file) is beyond the buffer size -> return 0 (EOF).
      - Otherwise, copy from the buffer starting at the current file position (f_pos) to the user, up to the requested count or the remaining bytes in the buffer.
      - Then update the file position.

     But note: the problem doesn't specify if the device should be seekable. We'll make it non-seekable? Actually, we can support lseek? But the problem says basic.

     Alternatively, we can ignore the file position and always read from the beginning? But that would break multiple reads.

     Let me think: if we have two reads without a write in between, the first read returns the entire buffer, the second read returns 0? Or we can use the file position.

     Actually, the standard way is to use the file position. The driver should support multiple reads that continue from where the last read left? 

     However, the problem says "basic". We can do:

        Option A: Each read returns the entire buffer (from the beginning) and then sets the file position to the end? Then the next read returns 0? 
        But that would require the user to seek to the beginning to read again? 

        Option B: We reset the file position to 0 on open? And then each read advances the file position? 

        But note: the same file descriptor is used by one process, so if the process does two reads, the second read would get 0? 

        How about we don't use the file position for the buffer? We want to allow multiple processes to read the same data? 

        Actually, the typical way for a simple device is to have the buffer as a global state and each read starts from the beginning? But then how do we handle multiple reads? 

        We can have:

          - The buffer and its size are global (per device). 
          - Each open file has its own file position.

        So if two processes open the device, they each have their own file position. But the buffer is shared. So if one process writes, then both processes will see the new data? 

        And if one process reads, it advances its own file position, but the other process starts at 0.

        This is acceptable.

        We'll do:

          - We store the buffer and its size in a global structure (for the device).
          - Each open file (struct file) has its own f_pos.

        For read:
          - We lock the mutex.
          - If the current f_pos is at or beyond the device_buffer_size, we return 0.
          - Otherwise, we calculate how many bytes we can read: min(count, device_buffer_size - f_pos)
          - Then we copy that many bytes from device_buffer + f_pos to user.
          - Then we update f_pos for that file.
          - Unlock the mutex.

        For write:
          - We lock the mutex.
          - We write the entire buffer? But note: the write operation also has a file position. But we are going to ignore it? 
          - The problem doesn't specify. We can either:

            a) Overwrite the entire buffer (reset the buffer) and set the file position for writing? But we are not tracking write position per file? 
            b) We are going to treat the device as having a single shared buffer. So any write will overwrite the entire buffer (and reset the size to the written count) and reset all file positions? 

          - But note: if we reset the buffer, then any ongoing read in another process will be
